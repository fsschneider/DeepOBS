  Args:
    batch_size (int): Batch size to use.

        Note: Some test problems do not use regularization and this value will
        be ignored in such a case.

  Attributes:
    dataset: The dataset used by the test problem (datasets.DataSet instance).
    train_init_op: A tensorflow operation initializing the test problem for the
        training phase.
    train_eval_init_op: A tensorflow operation initializing the test problem for
        evaluating on training data.
    test_init_op: A tensorflow operation initializing the test problem for
        evaluating on test data.
    losses: A tf.Tensor of shape (batch_size, ) containing the per-example loss
        values.
    regularizer: A scalar tf.Tensor containing a regularization term (might be
        a constant 0.0 for test problems that do not use regularization).
    accuracy: A scalar tf.Tensor containing the mini-batch mean accuracy.
