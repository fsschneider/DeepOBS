    neural network on MNIST.

  The network has been adapted from the `TensorFlow tutorial\
  <https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn>`_ and consists of

    - two conv layers with ReLUs, each followed by max-pooling
    - one fully-connected layers with ReLUs
    - 10-unit output layer with softmax
    - cross-entropy loss
    - No regularization

  The weight matrices are initialized with truncated normal (standard deviation
  of ``0.05``) and the biases are initialized to ``0.05``.

  Args:
    batch_size (int): Batch size to use.
    l2_reg (float): No L2-Regularization (weight decay) is used in this
        test problem. Defaults to ``None`` and any input here is ignored.

   Attributes:
    data: The DeepOBS data set class for MNIST.
    loss_function: The loss function for this testproblem is torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss().
    net: The DeepOBS subclass of torch.nn.Module that is trained for this tesproblem (net_mnist_2c2d).
