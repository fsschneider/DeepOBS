  The network has been adapted from the `here\
  <https://towardsdatascience.com/teaching-a-variational-autoencoder-vae-to-draw-mnist-characters-978675c95776>`_
  and consists of an encoder:

    - With three convolutional layers with each ``64`` filters.
    - Using a leaky ReLU activation function with :math:`\\alpha = 0.3`
    - Dropout layers after each convolutional layer with a rate of ``0.2``.

  and an decoder:

    - With two dense layers with ``24`` and ``49`` units and leaky ReLU activation.
    - With three deconvolutional layers with each ``64`` filters.
    - Dropout layers after the first two deconvolutional layer with a rate of ``0.2``.
    - A final dense layer with ``28 x 28`` units and sigmoid activation.

  No regularization is used.
