Welcome to DeepOBS
===================

DeepOBS is a benchmarking suite that drastically simplifies, automates and improves the evaluation of deep learning optimizers.

It can evaluate the performance of new optimizers on a variety of **real-world test problems** and automatically compare them with **realistic baselines**.

The code for the current implementation in TensorFlow can be found on `GitHub`_.
